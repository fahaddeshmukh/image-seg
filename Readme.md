# IDML-2 UNet for defective steel - image segmentation

## Introductions
 The primary objective of this project was to construct a segmentation model capable of segmenting defective regions from the images of steel sheets. The dataset provided for this task con sist of around 12000 images of 256*1600 size, with annotations file. Several preprocessing steps were employed to prepare the dataset for modeling.

## Summary:

The goal of this project was to train a U-Net model for steel defect image segmentation. Two variations of the U-Net architecture were implemented:

1. **Baseline U-Net**: This model used a simple CNN as the encoder.
2. **Complex U-Net**: This model utilized ResNet18 with pre-trained weights as the encoder.

### Evaluation Metrics:
Both models were evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice score metrics.

### Performance Comparison:
The complex U-Net model with ResNet18 as the encoder outperformed the baseline U-Net model. It achieved a Dice score of around 0.7, indicating superior segmentation performance.

### Testing Phase:
The complex U-Net model was tested on unseen images. It produced satisfactory segmentation masks, demonstrating its ability to generalize well to new data.

Overall, the project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of using a more complex architecture (U-Net with ResNet18) for steel defect image segmentation tasks. The model's performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics and validated through testing on unseen images, showcasing its potential for practical applications in steel defect detection and segmentation.
